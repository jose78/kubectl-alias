	Long: `This tool empowers you to customize your queries to Kubernetes resources using SQL. 
With support for JOIN operations, you can combine and filter data from multiple Kubernetes objects 
(Pods, ConfigMaps, Services, and more) seamlessly.

Key features:
- Write SQL queries to interact with Kubernetes resources.
- Perform JOINs across different Kubernetes object types.
- Customize subcommands and their behavior via a configuration file referenced by the KUBEALIAS environment variable.

Usage example:
kubectl alias subCommand arg1 arg2... argN

By defining subcommands (with or without arguments) in the KUBEALIAS configuration file, 
you can tailor the CLI to suit your specific Kubernetes query needs.`,
